# Expo 2020 Sentiment Analysis
 
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to conduct a sentiment analysis using python and twitter's API. The project is approached through five phases which are analogous to the data analytics life cycle.The following is a brief introduction to the topic

**What is Expo 2020?**
> Initiated in London 1851. It is a global gathering aimed to find solutions to challenges imposed by the current times. Aims  to create enriching and immersive experience. World expo traverses through different cities each time. It also revolves around certain themes. Currently, World expo is taking place in Dubai, UAE. Between Oct, 2021 and Mar, 2022. For more information please visit [expo2020dubai](https://www.expo2020dubai.com/)

**The goal of this project**
> As discussed above the main goal is to conduct a sentiment analysis and learn the basics of data science and big data projects. Since Expo 2020 is considered an educational exhibition that revolves around modern day problems and is hosted currently in the middle east. The goal is to measure the awareness of the arab society - *By arab society we mean anyone who posts their opinions in arabic* and their view on Expo 2020

## Phase One: Discovery
This part is about discovering and collecting as much data as possible that is relating to the topic at hand. I will be needing tweets that are written in Arabic. This phase is in [`tweets-collection.ipynb`](tweets-collection.ipynb) notebook.

## Phase Two: Pre-processing
In this phase we first explore the dataset in detail and then we clean and preform pre-processing techniques. This phase can be found in the `tweets-cleaning.ipynb` notebook. 

## Phase Three: Data Analysis and Model Building
Here we first conduct a statistical analysis and observe the general characteristics and distribution of the dataset which is provided in this notebook `tweets-statistics.ipynb`. Then, we move on to model building and we perform a sentiment analysis by evaluating three different models and fine-tune the best one. The notebook can be found here `tweets-analysis.ipynb` and the documentation can be found [here](Docs/SWE486_Phase3_Group8.pdf)

## Phase Four: Findings
We finally link our results back to our initial hypothesis and summarize our findings in this notebook `tweets-visualization.ipynb`.

## Phase Five: Presentation
The following is the final course presentation [expo_2020_presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFA2NMvgSU/fbhKPCGXxeDi2ssdvM6oZw/view?utm_content=DAFA2NMvgSU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)
